 Rising consumption capacity has caused a shift in Dashain shopping culture with consumers no longer concentrating on just clothes and food. Gone are the days when clothes and food took up most of the purchasing time and power of the people. Over the last decade or so, the shopping list has started to become longer and look different.  New clothes may still top the priority list, but attractive discounts and schemes offered by sellers present a new story.                   
                                    
                  

&quot;People do not just want to wear new clothes during Dashain these days. They want everything new,&quot; Anup K Baral, who heads the Passenger Car Business Unit for Tata Motors at Sipradi Trading Pvt Ltd, sums it up.

When it comes to cars, the festive season starts about a month before Dashain, according to Pradeep Shahi, Sales Director of Auto Link Pvt Ltd, which deals in second hand four-wheelers. Sales and exchanges nearly double during this time, he adds.

&quot;On an average, we sell around0 to5 vehicles a month. But the figures jump to around0 to5 a day during the months before Dashain,&rdquo; he added.

<img src="/Public/UserFiles/Image/citycenter.jpg" alt=""/>

According to Shahi, most of his clients want to upgrade to high-end vehicles. &quot;Some people change their vehicles every Dashain while others, who have had the same car for two to three years, find Dashain the best time to change,&rdquo; he added. Shahi also says people want to travel on a better car to visit their relative during the festival.

Another group of Shahi&acute;s clientele also includes people with two-wheelers who need to switch to a four-wheeler because their family has grown. &quot;The kids are bigger and you cannot take them to relatives on your bike anymore. So people choose to buy a small car.&quot;

Not only four-wheelers, bikes also see a big jump in sale during this festive season. According to Bijaya Kasajoo, Marketing Manager at Morang Auto Works, which sells Yamaha bikes, sales figure during the month before Dashain, especially during the final week, more than doubles compared to normal days. &quot;It is rooted in our society and minds that Dashain is the time to buy. It doesn&acute;t matter if it be clothes or a bike.&quot;

The biggest non-apparel sellers during Dashain are perhaps the distributors and retailers of consumer electronics. &quot;Dashain is the time when there is a temporary jump in disposable income of almost everyone, thanks mostly to the Dashain allowance that people get. So people want to invest that extra cash on fixed assets like television sets and fridges,&rdquo; says Amitesh Roy of Him Electronics, which deals in Samsung Electronics&acute; home products.  &ldquo;Plus these days, TVs and refrigerators have almost become a necessity.&quot;

Roy says the sales figures jump by around0 percent during the season with the higher percentage of buyers being middle class people buying level products and others preferring to upgrade or get a new TV and give their old ones to their children.

<img src="/Public/UserFiles/Image/shoppingmobile.jpg" alt=""/>

Large shopping centers in Kathmandu and wider availability of global brands have also changed people&acute;s buying habit. Only a few people are going to traditional shopping hubs like New Road and are moving into these large malls. &quot;Earlier, everyone used to jam into and around New Road before Dashain. That&acute;s not the case anymore. Out of around.5 million people who live in Kathmandu, two million will step inside a mall in ten days of Dashain shopping,&rdquo; Rajendra Aryal, who manages the NLIC City Center, told myrepublica.com.

Traders like Saroj Tuladhar of New Road-based Juju Readymade, which was started by his father, are at the receiving end of this shift in shopping habit. &quot;The economic situation isn&acute;t pretty. I have been in the business for around0 years and business this year is the worst. The only thing that is keeping this business going on during this Dashain is kids&acute; clothes,&quot; he says. Tuladhar feels that people invest more on jewelry than cars or electronics. &quot;Unlike those other things, the value of jewelry goes up as time goes by. They can flaunt jewelry during festive season and also get a better return later,&quot; Tuladhar concludes.                </p>

 Nepal Army Club (NAC) clinched their first title of the year on Sunday. NAC defeated the U-19 team of ANFA Academy-1 in the final of Club Level National Football Tournament held at Anbu Khaireni to take home the trophy.                   
                                    
                  

<img src="/Public/UserFiles/Image/nacclubfootball1.jpg" alt=""/>

The match took the turn to tie-breaker following a-1 stalemate and the added time of the match. Academy&acute;s Rohit Chand&acute;s first strike skied above the post while NAC custodian Bikash Malla saved Deepak Bhusal&acute;s shot. Rupesh KC of the Academy who made second attempt won a goal for the team.  On the other hand, Chun Bahadur Thapa, Mahendra Khawas and Hiran Magar converted for NAC which was sufficient to decide the fate of the match.  NAC&acute;s Santosh Nepali&acute;s shot rebounded hitting the pole.

Earlier, the NAC which lead the match twice had to wait until tie-breaker after they failed to maintain the lead. Amrit Basnet gave lead to NAC in the injury time of the first taking the advantage of the miss-pass of the Academy team. Amrit scored chipping the ball while the opponent custodian was bit ahead of the goalpost.

Technically sound Academy team who gave good lesson to NAC with their performance leveled the match0 minute before the finishing time. Shiva Shrestha scored for the Academy team who made the physically opponent team helpless with short and quick passes.  Shrestha, the man-of- the-match of final, scored through header utilizing a rebounded ball off the powerful rebounded shot of Rohit Chand in the empty post.

Again, the NAC again took the lead in the added time too through Ram Kumar Biswas who had entered the ground as the substitute player. Biswas scored in the fifth minute through header. But the young colt of Academy determined to return the goal equalized the match before in the last minute of the added time.  Sujal  Shrestha headed to score in the free kick of Deepak Bhusal.

<img src="/Public/UserFiles/Image/nacclubfootball3.jpg" alt=""/>

&ldquo;They displayed a technically sound game but the result came in our favor,&rdquo; NAC coach Raju Shakya commented after the match.  &ldquo;The young players are technically good and they have good team set and they have bright future,&rdquo; NAC captain Bikash said.

NAC coach on the other hand said, &ldquo;We won the match technically but lost in terms of results.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Had we not wasted few chances in the beginning we could have won the match in the regular time.&rdquo;

<img src="/Public/UserFiles/Image/nacclubfootball4.jpg" alt=""/>

The winners NAC bagged a purse of Rs,11,11 while Academy took away Rs0,000. Nirajan Malla of the Academy got the highest scorer award for scoring three goals in the tournament while Bikash Malla and Santosh Nepali got the best goalkeeper and best player award respectively. The Academy also won the fair play award.

 With people on a shopping spree and shoppers crowding malls, departmental stores and almost every major outlet, Dashain market this year is vibrant like never before.

And why not, say economists, Nepalis now possess much more money to spend than they ever had. To justify their statements, they quote figures like rise in disposable income, increase in private consumption and soaring remittance transfer.                   
                                    
                  

<img alt="" src="/Public/UserFiles/Image/dashainshopping.jpg"/>

For instance, statistics of Ministry of Finance shows that gross disposable income of Nepalis together (at current price) has soared to a total of Rs193.40 billion -- a figure which is almost two-fold of what was recorded five years ago. This means, people at present hold double disposable income than what they possessed in Dashain of004/05.

Likewise, the national income data further shows that Nepalis are spending Rs83 billion of that disposable income for consumption. Of that, spending of general people&acute;s private spending alone stands at Rs60 billion (86 percent of total consumption). If one compares this private consumption figure with that of004/05, which was Rs59.53 billion then, s/he would understand why the Dashain market have boomed like never before this year, despite gloom in the political sphere and galloping inflation.

Apart from regular figures, Dashain is also marked by the injection of extra money into circulation. Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has estimated that people are receiving extra money of some Rs0 billion. That includes Rs billion in the form of special Dashain advances and Rs2 billion in the form of additional remittance inflow. The purpose of all this transfers is to enable people enjoy the festive season. And the regular salary income worth some Rs billion and overseas workers and pension transfer worth Rs0 billion is also there for consumption.

<img width="480" height="661" alt="" src="/Public/UserFiles/Image/dashaingoats.jpg"/>

If past trend is any benchmark, people will spend about0 percent of that money on food items,0 percent on non-food items and0 percent on services including travel.

That is why managers of shopping malls like Rajendra Aryal of City Center believe that more than one million people will visit malls aspiring to buy items of their taste this season. To add colors and charm the shoppers, they have unveiled various schemes with attractive gift hampers. Suppliers of electronics goods, which used to remain out of Dashain shopping list in the past, are announcing schemes in a big way to lure consumers.

Transportation entrepreneurs said more people are leaving Kathmandu to their parental homes for celebrations this season than the last few years. Because of the attractive travel packages various agencies offered, a portion of high-end middle income groups are even going out for overseas tours this Dashain.
